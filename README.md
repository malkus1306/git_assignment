# a. What is an issue?
As I understand the issue is a kind of comment to facilitate your work with the repo. It could be used for many different purposes, i.e. to provide feedback, to discuss ideas or simply to provide feedback.

# b. What is a pull request?
Pull request is a tool to merge changes from one branch into another before these changes are integrated into the main codebase. It also allows communicating with other teammates and adding follow-up commits.
