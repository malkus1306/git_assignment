# a. What is an issue?
As I understand the issue is a kind of comment to facilitate your work with the repo. It could be used for many different purposes, i.e. to provide feedback, to discuss ideas or simply to provide feedback.

# b. What is a pull request?
Pull request is a tool to merge changes from one branch into another before these changes are integrated into the main codebase. It also allows communicating with other teammates and adding follow-up commits.

# c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
1. Open my account on GitHub
2. Select the repo where I want to open a pull request
3. Select "Pull request"
4. Select the button "New pull request" on the new page
5. Select a branch I plan to merge the changes from and select the branch I plan to merge the changes into
6. Hit the "Create pull request" button

# d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
1. Open my account on GitHub
2. Select the repo where I want to open a pull request
3. Select "Settings" in the menu
4. On the left-side menu select "Collaborators"
5. In the area "Manage access" hit the button "Add people"
6. Provide the username (his/her account name in GitHub) of the person you plan to collaborate and select the role "Write"

# e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the most common Version Control System. It is open-sourced and free, mainly installed locally to track changes made to files. GitHub is a commercial project (however, with some functionality available for free) dedicated to storing, sharing and working with other people to develop code.

# f. What does git diff do?
git diff provides additional details about the changes made. It compares our current files (code in the working directory) to what is in the staging area.

# g. What is the main branch?
main branch (sometimes called the master branch) is the name provided by GitHub to the default branch. This default branch is supposed to be used for creating new branches and all final changes are normally merged into this main branch

# h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
Pushing changes directly to the main branch depends on the context of a project. Although this is technically possible, it is not always recommended, especially in collaborative or large projects. main branch is used to store the final code used in the production of the system we are developing. Therefore, during the development process and collaboration, it is not recommended to push changes directly into the main branch.
