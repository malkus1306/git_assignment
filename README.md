# e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is the most common Version Control System. It is open-sourced and free, mainly installed locally to track changes made to files. GitHub is a commercial project (however, with some functionality available for free) dedicated to storing, sharing and working with other people to develop code.

# f. What does git diff do?
git diff provides additional details about the changes made. It compares our current files (code in the working directory) to what is in the staging area.
